0
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,240
All right, now before we go anywhere

1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,460
I just want to point out the little logo that&#39;s

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,490
sitting behind me.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,180
And I also want to mention the fact

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,390
that real recently at Ignite, which sort of dates when this

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,780
was recorded, Ignite being the big annual Microsoft

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,760
conference, there&#39;s actually a whole set of pins that had,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,684
Microsoft hearts Linux, on it.

8
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:24,100
And I&#39;ve actually written a couple

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,710
a blog posts about Microsoft and Open Source.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,030
So you may be wondering, OK, well,

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,610
what is Christopher about to do here?

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,650
Well Christopher is about to do a demo on Visual Studio

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,760
Code, which is an IDE created by us, created by Microsoft,

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,050
that will work on Windows, will work on Mac OS,

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,170
and will work on Linux.

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,500
And I&#39;m actually going to be doing this demo using a Linux

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,590
VM that is running on Azure.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,460
And by the way, as a real quick side note,

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,110
I promise to not refer to myself in the third person

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,300
for the rest of this video.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,340
Now, what I want to do is walk through how

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,430
to go get Bootstrap and the files

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,440
that are going to be required and how to get started

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,420
with Visual Studio code.

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,170
I do want to mention just as a real quick caveat,

26
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,450
you are going to notice that the demos that I&#39;m

27
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,600
going to be doing where I&#39;ll actually get in and start

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,210
using Bootstrap, are going to be in the full copy of Visual

29
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,000
Studio.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,830
And again, if you are using Windows,

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,350
you can use Visual Studio Community for free.

32
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,330
But if you&#39;re not using Windows, or if you just

33
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,200
want to play with another IDE, integrated development

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,090
environment, you&#39;re free to do that.

35
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,850
And Visual Studio code is freely available for you.

36
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,759
Now, let&#39;s go ahead and take look at my environment here.

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,300
And I just want to highlight the fact

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,050
that I&#39;ve got two little folders that I&#39;ve

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,100
created on my desktop.

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,450
I&#39;ve got Bootstrap demo and then I&#39;ve got Visual Studio Code.

41
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,960
And then you&#39;ll also notice that I&#39;ve got my copy of Firefox

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,630
here.

43
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,644
Now I&#39;ve already got the three tabs open that I need.

44
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:02,060
And so what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m

45
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,350
going to go grab the Bootstrap files that I want,

46
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,820
I&#39;m going to go grab the jQuery file,

47
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,750
and then I&#39;m going to close all that off

48
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,010
by grabbing Visual Studio Code, and seeing how we can

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,710
get everything up and running.

50
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,580
So step one here is I&#39;m just going to click

51
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,942
on Download Bootstrap here.

52
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,400
And then right here, I&#39;m just going

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,669
to click on Download Bootstrap.

54
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,710
So I&#39;m just going to go ahead and open up the zip

55
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,310
file with the Archive Manager.

56
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,030
And then what you&#39;re going to notice inside

57
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,270
of that little Bootstrap 3.3.4 distribution

58
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,870
is a CSS folder which will have our CSS files.

59
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,320
We&#39;re going to have a Fonts folder which will have

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,140
our glyph icons and our fonts.

61
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,940
And then last, but not least is a JS folder that

62
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,840
will have our JavaScript files.

63
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,930
Now what I&#39;m going to do is, I&#39;m going to put those

64
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,050
into our Bootstrap demo folder.

65
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,255
So I&#39;m just going to do a real quick drag and drop of those.

66
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,890
There we go.

67
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,140
And I&#39;m going to do a little bit of cleanup work here.

68
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,810
That I really don&#39;t like the name,

69
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,940
CSS, so I&#39;m just going to rename that to be Styles.

70
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,090
And I really don&#39;t like the name JS.

71
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,160
I&#39;m going to rename that to be, Scripts.

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,830
So now you&#39;re going to notice inside of my Bootstrap demo

73
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,870
folder that I&#39;ve got Fonts, I&#39;ve got Scripts

74
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,280
and I&#39;ve got Styles.

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,940
So now I&#39;ve got the Bootstrap files that I&#39;m going to need,

76
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,190
but I also need jQuery in order for all

77
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,260
the Bootstrap functionality to work.

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,310
So I just navigate on over to jQuery.com,

79
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,250
I click, Download jQuery.

80
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,510
And then if I scroll on down here, I&#39;ve got my jQuery 2.x,

81
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,470
and that will actually work just fine.

82
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,710
I want the compressed production jQuery.

83
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,180
So I&#39;m just going to click that.

84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,530
And what you&#39;ll notice is that it will then just

85
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,610
open it up inside of Firefox, so you can read jQuery

86
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,520
there if you like.

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,310
But an easier thing to do is, is just

88
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,770
to right-click on that link.

89
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:14,120
And then just click on Save Link As.

90
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,130
And then we&#39;ll go ahead and navigate back to our desktop.

91
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,779
We&#39;ll navigate on into Bootstrap demo, into Scripts,

92
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,560
and then we&#39;ll save it inside of there.

93
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,800
OK, cool.

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,740
Now last thing is to go grab Visual Studio Code.

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,979
So let&#39;s just go to Visual Studio Code.

96
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,020
I&#39;ve already got the tab.

97
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,950
You&#39;ll notice the URL there is Code.VisualStudio.com.

98
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,060
It&#39;s detecting the fact that running Linux,

99
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,530
so it automatically prompts me, hey download code for Linux.

100
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,410
So let me just click that.

101
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,550
And I&#39;ll just let it open up with the default to Archive

102
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,370
Manager again.

103
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,400
And now I&#39;m just going to extract all of this.

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,950
So let me just click, Extract.

105
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,700
And let&#39;s go back into the desktop, and then this time

106
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,860
into Visual Studio Code, and click, Extract.

107
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,290
So now what I&#39;ve done here is I&#39;ve

108
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,330
created the environment that we&#39;ll

109
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,420
be doing our Bootstrap work in.

110
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,590
And I&#39;ve now downloaded Visual Studio Code

111
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,800
and extracted that out to a folder.

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,160
OK, now if I click on Show The Files here,

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,904
what you&#39;re going to notice is that it&#39;s

114
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,070
got a whole set of files and so forth that it needs.

115
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,555
All I have to do is just double click on Code.

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,290
And that launch Visual Studio Code for me.

117
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,920
Beautiful.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,820
OK, now you are going to notice that it automatically gives me

119
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,190
a little Welcome tab, going to show us how everything

120
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,300
is designed to work, and you can read

121
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,570
more if you want right there.

122
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,320
I&#39;m just going to close that out and I&#39;m

123
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,040
going to make one very big change here.

124
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,000
I&#39;m going to click on View, Theme,

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,810
and I&#39;m going to go to Light Theme, which

126
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,250
is going to make things much easier to read on the screen.

127
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,500
And I&#39;m also, by using Control and then the equal sign,

128
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,180
I&#39;m going to zoom in a little bit more,

129
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,200
just to make things that much easier to read.

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,910
Now what you&#39;re going to notice over here

131
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,770
is we&#39;ve got a set of little icons here.

132
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,380
So for example, you&#39;ll notice that I can connect up to Get.

133
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,010
The one I&#39;m going to want is Explore.

134
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,090
So I&#39;m just going to click, Explore,

135
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,530
and then I&#39;m going to click, Open Folder.

136
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,240
And that will then allow me to go open up that Bootstrap demo.

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,030
So I&#39;m just going to hit, Bootstrap demo.

138
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,270
I&#39;m going to click, OK.

139
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,290
So you&#39;ll notice by having opened up that Bootstrap

140
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,000
demo that of course I&#39;ve got everything inside of there.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,940
That I&#39;ve got my Fonts, I&#39;ve got my Scripts,

142
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,340
and I&#39;ve got my Styles.

143
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,770
Now for right now, I&#39;m just going

144
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,450
to go ahead and collapse all of these.

145
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,960
And I&#39;m going to make sure that nothing is selected.

146
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,270
So I just clicked right in this little grayish area

147
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,180
on the lower left.

148
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,690
And you&#39;ll notice that when I highlight over Bootstrap demo

149
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,470
that I automatically get the ability to create

150
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,560
brand new file.

151
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,650
So I&#39;m just going to click, New File.

152
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,370
And I&#39;m going to call this index.html.

153
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,820
Hit Enter, and now of course you&#39;re

154
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,460
going to notice that it will give me an HTML editor.

155
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,480
So I could go in and add HTML.

156
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,230
I could go ahead and add head, and title,

157
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,350
Welcome to Visual Studio Code.

158
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,180
And then sneak down into the body here.

159
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,130
And now I&#39;ve got my very basic little HTML page.

160
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,900
Now in order to add the appropriate items

161
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,390
in for Bootstrap, I&#39;m going to need two Script files and one

162
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,680
Style file.

163
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,740
The two Script files that I&#39;m going to need is the minified

164
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,960
version of jQuery, so I can do that by saying, Script,

165
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,790
SRC equals, and then let&#39;s go ahead and point

166
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,850
at jQuery-2.1.4-- and that should of course be a dash

167
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,190
rather than a minus.

168
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,020
There we go-- .min.js.

169
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,480
And remember of course that the minified versions

170
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,470
are going to be the ones that will

171
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,680
be all compressed, no white space, things like that.

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,320
And then let&#39;s go ahead and add in another Script tag,

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,970
and then SRC equals, and then we&#39;ll say bootstrap.min.js.

174
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,500
And it is worth noting here that if you wanted

175
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,932
to reference a CDN, a content delivery network,

176
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,140
you could absolutely do that.

177
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,200
I&#39;m just going local here for those files.

178
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,770
So I&#39;ve got my couple little JavaScript files right there.

179
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,450
And then I also need a Style.

180
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,710
And the one that I&#39;m going to need is that bootstrap.min.css,

181
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:05,278
so I&#39;m just going to say, link, rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;.

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,702
And then href= and then we&#39;ll go ahead and point at, in my case,

183
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:17,785
/styles/bootstrap.min.css.

184
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,280
And I&#39;m just noticing here I&#39;ve got a couple of little typos.

185
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,790
I do need to fix the spelling of Bootstrap.

186
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,650
We&#39;ll do that.

187
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,710
And I also need to specify that these are inside

188
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,440
of my Scripts folder.

189
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,000
There we go.

190
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,630
OK, and again, I&#39;m just going to keep having typos.

191
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,370
Beautiful.

192
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,330
So now, I&#39;ve got everything set up inside my basic HTML.

193
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,270
I always like a jumbotron to do a real quick check just

194
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,010
to make sure that everything&#39;s working.

195
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,051
So I&#39;m just going to say, div class=&#39;containter&#39;.

196
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,920
And then we&#39;ll say, div class=&#39;jumbotron&#39;.

197
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:20,190
And then let&#39;s throw in an h2 and &quot;Hello Visual Studio Code.&quot;

198
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,500
Just like that.

199
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,320
OK, cool.

200
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,310
So now I&#39;ve got everything set up just the way

201
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,040
that I want that.

202
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,720
So now let&#39;s go ahead and save it just Control-S will do that.

203
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,530
I&#39;m going to right-click and say, Open Containing Folder,

204
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,640
just to open up the folder that it&#39;s in.

205
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,580
Go a little bit old school there.

206
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,940
And then I&#39;ll just double-click on Index HTML, that

207
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,280
will open up inside of Mozilla Firefox for me

208
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,730
and display my little jumbotron with

209
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,090
that Hello, Visual Studio Code!

210
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,450
And just to kind of prove that it

211
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,220
is in fact using my Bootstrap, kinda

212
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,750
go one step further with this, let&#39;s even

213
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,740
just add in a real quick button.

214
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:15,600
And let&#39;s just say, class=btn, btn=success, and Hello button.

215
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,270
And let&#39;s again just hit, Save.

216
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,460
Let&#39;s go back to Firefox, hit, Refresh,

217
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,700
and then there&#39;s my little green button.

218
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,080
So here&#39;s the basic steps just one more time.

219
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,720
I created a little folder called, Bootstrap demo.

220
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,660
Created three folders inside of there, one for my Fonts

221
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,670
with the fonts from Bootstrap.

222
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,010
One with my Scripts with both jQuery and Bootstrap.

223
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,740
And then last but not least one with the Styles

224
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,540
that contains the appropriate CSS.

225
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,590
I grab Visual Studio Code.

226
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,390
Just threw that into a folder.

227
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,590
And I open that up, created my little index.

228
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,960
I referenced my Style Sheets.

229
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,200
I referenced my couple of little Scripts.

230
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,450
And then I went in and added my little bit of code.

231
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,490
And so you&#39;ll notice that you could use Visual Studio

232
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,340
Code to walk through all of the demos, and all of the labs

233
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,430
that are going to be associated with this course.

234
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,930
So if you don&#39;t want to use Windows,

235
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,090
if you want to use Mac, if you want to use Linux,

236
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,700
you could go ahead and use this as well.
